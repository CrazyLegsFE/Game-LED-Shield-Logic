# Game-LED-Shield-Logic
Buttonbox LED shield logic to incorporate into your project
DESCRIPTION:
This project controls some logic to represent power state and where shield power is based off your inputs (up, down, left, right)  
INTENT:
The code for game/simlulator incorporation is not included as it may vary for your application.  The orginal intent is for use in button box projects(simulator, games, ect.)
APPLICATION:
The code is written for an Atmega microcontroller (arduino compatible) but could be adapted to many other uses.
ABOUT THE AUTHOR:
This is my first Github project and I learned alot making this so there are probably glaring ommissions, errors, or lack of efficiency in this code.
FUTURE SCOPE:
I would like to add more features to include possible state readout in percentage where the "shields are pushed".  Also working on a similiar project about system power diversion that should be out in the coming weeks. They will probably be combined at some point.
